_Installation_
Simply do "make install" on a compatible Xen Dom0. Then ensure NAT is configured as documented below, and that a pool of IP addresses has been generated.

Instructions on creating a Debian Dom0 are documented at https://wiki.debian.org/Xen#Domain_0_.28Host.29_Installation .

_NAT_

Something like the following will be needed for network configuration in /etc/network/interfaces .

auto br
	iface br inet static
	bridge_ports none
	bridge_stp no
	address 10.174.0.1
	netmask 255.255.0.0
	network 10.174.0.0/16
	broadcast 10.174.255.255

_InitIPs_
Run the hxInitIPs script to initialize the pool of usable IP addresses for new Xen servers.
