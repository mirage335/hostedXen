_Installation_
Simply do "make install" on a compatible Xen Dom0. Then ensure NAT is configured as documented below, and that a pool of IP addresses has been generated.

Instructions on creating a Debian Dom0 are documented at https://wiki.debian.org/Xen#Domain_0_.28Host.29_Installation .

_NAT_
-Sysctl-
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

-IPTables-
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

-Forwarding-
/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 20283 -j DNAT --to 10.174.10.5:22

-Interface-
Something like the following will be needed for network configuration in /etc/network/interfaces .

auto br
	iface br inet static
	bridge_ports none
	bridge_stp no
	address 10.174.0.1
	netmask 255.255.0.0
	network 10.174.0.0/16
	broadcast 10.174.255.255



_InitIPs_
Run the hxInitIPs script to initialize the pool of usable IP addresses for new Xen servers.

_Xen CFG_
*) Uncomment lines referring to "-nat" and comment other vif-script/network-script lines in /etc/xen/xend-config.sxp .
*) Uncomment "dir = /home/xen" in /etc/xen-tools/xen-tools.conf .
